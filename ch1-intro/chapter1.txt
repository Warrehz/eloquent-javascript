6 basic types of values in JavaScript - numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values

available arithmetic (binary) operators - multiplication *, division /, addition +, subraction -, and remainder %
e.g. x & y is the remainder of dividing x by y - 2 % 2 = 0, 4 % 3 = 1

(unary) operators - typeof
e.g. console.log(typeof 4.5)
     // > number

comparisons - greater than >, less than <, greater than equal to >=, less than equal to <=

logical operators - and &&, or ||, not !, and ternary ?
e.g. console.log(true ? 1 : 2)
     // > 1
     console.log(false ? 1 : 2)
     // > 2

     when true the first option is chosen, when false the second

JavaScript changes value type when an operator us used on the wrong type of value - also known as type coercion

0, NaN, and "" will count as false

short-circuit evaluation - || will return the value to the left when it can be converted to true, else return the value to the right
                           && will return the value to the left when it can be converted to false, else return the value to the right

                           *the value to the right is only evaluated when necessary
