functions wrap code to structure programs, reduce repetition, associate names with sub-programs, and to isolate them from others
e.g. var square = function(num) {
  return num * num;
};

variables created inside functions, including their parameters, are local to the function
  those declared outside function are global - scope helps to prevent accidental interference between functions

functions can be created inside others, created various degrees of locality

function declarations are not part of the typical top-to-bottom flow of control

in JavaScript, if you pass too many arguments to a function all others after the necessary are ignored
  if you pass too few, the missing parameters are assigned the value of undefined

closure - being able to reference a specific instance of a local variable in an enclosed function
  this frees you from having to worry about the lifetime of variables

a recursive function is one that calls itself

**don't worry about efficiency until you know the program is too slow**
