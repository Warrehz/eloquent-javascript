with objects one attempts to manage complexity by breaking up a program into smaller components

methods are properties of an object that holds a function
  e.g. var dog = {
        type: "mutt",
        size: "medium",
        bark: function() {
          console.log("WOOF!");
        }
       }

typically a method does something with the object it was called on

a prototype is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties
  when an object is called for a property that it does NOT have, it's prototype will then be searched, and then the prototype prototype
  the entity behind most prototypes is Object.prototype

Object.getPrototypeOf(dog); will return the prototype of the dog object

Object.create() can be used to create an object of a particular prototype
  e.g. var protoRabbit = {
        speak: function(line) {
          console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says, '" + line + "'");
        }
       }

       var evilRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
       evilRabbit.type = "evil";
       evilRabbit.speak("I'M GONNA GET YA!");
       // > The evil rabbit says, 'I'M GONNA GET YA!'

constructors provide a more convenient way to create objects from a shared prototype
e.g. function Person(name, sex, age, personality) {
      this.name = name;
      this.sex = sex;
      this.age = age;
      this.personality = personality;
     }

     var employee1 = new Person("Jebediah Thompson", "Male", "30", "Inquisitive");

    **It is convention to capitalize the name of constructors so that they can be easily distinguished from other functions**

when you add a property to an object it'll override the current property, if it already exists
e.g. employee1.age = 31;
this is often a valuable thing to do, allowing you to easily alter properties as needed

prototype interference - a prototype can be used to add properties and methods to all objects based on it
e.g. Person.prototype.phoneNumber = "xxx-xxx-xxxx;

you can iterate over an object using a "for/in" loop
e.g. namesList = {
      "bob": 31,
      "steve": 23,
      "quentin": 44,
      "jerome": 17
     }

     for (name in namesList) {
      console.log(name);
     }

enumerable properties are those that we add to an object ourselves, nonenumerable properties are those that come with the prototype such as toString();

we can create our own nonenumerable properties by using Object.defineProperty function
e.g. Object.defineProperty(Person.prototype, "SSN",
                           {enumerable: false, value: "xxx-xx-xxxx"});

polymorphism - when code is written to work with objects that have a certain type of interface, such as a toString(); method. polymorphic code can work
               with different values as long as they support the interface it expects

inheritance - allows us to build different data types from existing ones with little effort
this is often confused with polymorphism but can be easily misused in terrible ways - encapsulation and polymorphism allow for less tangled code, inheritance causes more tangle

instanceof is a binary operator that will tell you if an object is derived from another
e.g. console.log([1] instanceof Array);
     // > true
