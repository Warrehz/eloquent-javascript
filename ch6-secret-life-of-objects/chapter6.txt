with objects one attempts to manage complexity by breaking up a program into smaller components

methods are properties of an object that holds a function
  e.g. var dog = {
        type: "mutt",
        size: "medium",
        bark: function() {
          console.log("WOOF!");
        }
       }

typically a method does something with the object it was called on

a prototype is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties
  when an object is called for a property that it does NOT have, it's prototype will then be searched, and then the prototype prototype
  the entity behind most prototypes is Object.prototype

Object.getPrototypeOf(dog); will return the prototype of the dog object

Object.create() can be used to create an object of a particular prototype
  e.g. var protoRabbit = {
        speak: function(line) {
          console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says, '" + line + "'");
        }
       }

       var evilRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
       evilRabbit.type = "evil";
       evilRabbit.speak("I'M GONNA GET YA!");
       // > The evil rabbit says, 'I'M GONNA GET YA!'

constructors provide a more convenient way to create objects from a shared prototype
e.g. function Person(name, sex, age, personality) {
      this.name = name;
      this.sex = sex;
      this.age = age;
      this.personality = personality;
     }

     var employee1 = new Person("Jebediah Thompson", "Male", "30", "Inquisitive");

    **It is convention to capitalize the name of constructors so that they can be easily distinguished from other functions**
