JavaScript can be made slightly more strict by enabling strict mode
  e.g. "use strict";
  this can be done at the top of the file or function body

in strict mode, the this binding holds a value of undefined in functions that are not called as methods
  outside strict mode, this would refer to the global scope variable

it also disallows giving functions multiple parameters with the same name, and other problematic language features

tl;dr - "use strict"; never hurts and may help spot a problem

testing frameworks provide language in the form of functions and methods to express tests and output valuable information

error propagation - errors don't always come internally from code - anytime a user interacts with a program there is a chance for error to be created

exception handing - when a function can't proceed normally and jumps back to a place that knows how to handle the problem
  it raises or throws and exception or value
  raising an exception is like a super charged return from a function - it jumps out of all its callers
  this is called unwinding the stack

stack trace - information about the call stack that existed when the exception was created
