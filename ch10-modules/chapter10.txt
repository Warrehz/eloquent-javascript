module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on and
which functionality it provides for other modules to use (its interface)

relations between modules are called dependencies

an advantage to building programs out of separate pieces is that they may be used by other programs

a package is a chunk of code that can be copied and installed
  may contain one or more modules
  will contain information on what packages it depends on

an infrastructure is necessary to use packages
  NPM - https://www.npmjs.com/ is that infrastructure
  it is a location where users can download and upload packages
  it is also a program bundled with node.js that helps manage packages

  commonjs is the most common approach to bolted on javascript modules
