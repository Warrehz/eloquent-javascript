webpage can be interpreted as a word document
  it is made up of a series of nested boxes
  many are displayed as blocks on top of each other with some being inline or within the boxes
  each node or element refers to other nodes/children

the document object model can also be represented as a tree
  a branching structure with no cycles (a node cannot contain itself)
  a single well defined root (document.documentElement)

each DOM node object has a nodeType property
  contains a code (number) that identifies the type of node
  e.g. document.body.nodeType returns 1

trying to get an element at a specific location in the DOM is not fun/good
  e.g. get the third element of the second div in the body
  assumes too much about the structure of the DOM

document.createElement lets you create element nodes
