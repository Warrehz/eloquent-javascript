objects allow you to group values - including other objects

array - data type for storing a sequence of values
  e.g. names = ["henry", "vincent", "jozef", "gael"];
  console.log(names[2]);
  // > "jozef"

you will typically access properties using the dot notation
  e.g. myString.length - can also use myString["length"]

properties that contain functions are called methods of the value they belong to
  e.g. .toUpperCase is a method of a string

values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties - we can add and remove them as we please
  e.g. var person1 = {
        name: "john",
        age: 29,
        sex: "male",
        hobbies: ["reading", "eating", "movies", "lounging"]
       };

curly braces have to meanings - at start of statement they start a block of statements, every other instance they describe a an object

numbers, strings, and Booleans are immutable - it is impossible to change an existing value of those types

properties of an object CAN be changed - consider this example of mutability
  e.g. var object1 = {value: 10};
       var object2 = object1;
       var object3 = {value: 10};

       console.log(object1 == object2);
       // > true
       console.log(object1 == object3);
       // > false

  object 1 and 2 grasp the same object, object 3 points to a different object but with a property of the same name

JavaScript provides a looping construct specifically for properties in an object
  e.g. for (var event in journal) {
              console.log("'The correlation for '" + event + "' is '" + journal[event]);
           };

arguments object is added to the environment whenever a function is called - it holds all the arguments that are passed to that function
  e.g. function countArguments() {
          console.log("You gave me " + arguments.length + " arguments.");
       };

       countArguments("biscuit", "gravy", "eggs");
       // > You gave me 3 arguments.

global object - the space in which global objects live, each variable is present as a property of this object
  e.g. var soup = "split pea";
       console.log("soup" in window);
       // > true
       console.log(window.soup);
       // > split pea

**methods are functions that live in properties and usually act on the value they are a property of**
