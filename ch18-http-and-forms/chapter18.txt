remote procedure calls
  communication follows the patterns of normal function calls
  (the function actually runs on another machine)
  invoking the function makes a request to the server that includes the name and arguments
  the response to the request contains the returned value

http is just a vehicle for communication and will likely end up being hidden by an abstraction layer

security
  https wraps http data in a way that makes it harder to read and tamper with
  all data is encrypted

forms
  common form fields
    text
    radio
    email
    password
    checkbox
    files
  individual form fields cannot be submitted, only whole forms
