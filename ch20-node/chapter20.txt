run javascript files in terminal with node
  e.g. node program.js
  console.log will output to terminal

the [process] binding is available globally in node
  provides various ways to inspect and manipulate the current program

process.argv will provide an array of strings
  e.g. node program.js one and two
  will be represented as ["node", "program.js", "one", "and", "two"]

all the standard JS bindings are available in node environment
  e.g. Array, Math, JSON
  document related functionality like prompts and alerts are not

modules
  if you want to access built-in functionality, you have to ask the module system
  (commonJS module system based on the 'require' function)

  when require is called node has to resolve the given string into a file it can load
  understanding pathnames is important here
    /, ./, ../ are resolved relative to the current module path
    . means current directory
    ../ means one directory up
    / for the root of the file system
    the .js extension can be omitted

  when a string is not a relative or absolute path, it is assumed to refer to a
  built-in module or a module installed in the node_modules directory
    e.g. require("fs") will give nodes built-in file system module

  adding properties to exports adds them to the interface of the module
  they can then be exported and used elsewhere
    e.g. exports.reverse(string) { return Array.from(string).reverse.join(""); };

         files can then have const {reverse} = require("./reverse")

installing with npm
  npm is an online repository of js modules written for node
  by default packages are installed under the current directory
    this differs from package managers but the benefit is that each application
    is in charge of and control of the packages it uses

  package files
    the package.json file contains meta data about the project/app
      e.g. name, current version, description, modules used
           {
              "author": "Marijn Haverbeke",
              "name": "eloquent-javascript-robot",
              "description": "Simulation of a package-delivery robot",
              "version": "1.0.0",
              "main": "run.js",
              "dependencies": {
                "dijkstrajs": "^1.0.1",
                "random-item": "^1.0.0"
              },
                "license": "ISC"
            }

    versions
      package.json lists both the version of itself and its dependencies
      npm requires for packages to follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z format)
        e.g. 4.7.6
             4 = major changes break the API
             7 = minor version with changes that don't break API
             6 = patches - bug fixes
