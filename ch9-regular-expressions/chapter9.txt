regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data

square brackets [] let you test for any characters within the brackets
a dash indicates a range
  e.g. [0123456789] or [0-9]

commonly used shortcuts
    \d any digit character
    \w any alphanumeric character
    \s any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
    \D any character that is NOT a digit
    \W any character that is NOT alphanumeric
    \S a non whitespace character
    .  any character except newline

to invert a set of characters - match anything besides what are in brackets, use ^ after opening bracket
    e.g. [^01], anything but 0 or 1

putting a plus sign (+) after something in a regex means it can be repeated any number of times
    e.g. [\d+], any digit one more times

putting an asterisk (*) after something is similar to plus sign but allows matching zero times
    e.g. [\d*], any digit zero or more times

a question mark (?) makes part of the pattern optional, zero times or one time
    e.g. [neighbou?r], allows for spelling of neigbour and neighbor

braces ({}) indicate a pattern should occur a specified number of times
you can specify open-ended ranges by having a blank after the comma {2, }
    e.g. /\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}-\d{4} \d{1,2}:\d{2}/;

to use * or + more than once in a regex you have to group subexpressions
    let cartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/;
    the first and second + apply only to the second o of each word, the third + applies to the whole word

an i at the end of an expression makes it case insensitive
    let cartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/i;

JavaScript has a built in class for representing dates
    e.g. let time = new Date();
